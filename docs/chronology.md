# The Pāṇini Protocol: The Complete Saga from Challenge to Block

This is the full account of the Pāṇini Protocol: a scholarly encounter that began in good faith, passed the fire of public challenge, and ended in evasive silence. It is a case study in how a **publicity-driven claim**, never meant to withstand academic scrutiny, folds when it meets formal critique.

## Prologue: "Perhaps This Is All A Misunderstanding"
***December 2024 - February 2025***

Early reactions to Yajnadevam’s claims were cautious, even generous. What he prsented as "Sanskrit" showed clear grammatical faults — but many assumed the information theoretic basis was sound.

We reached out in good faith:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sir, while your methods indeed seem mathematically sound and fascinating, it&#39;s still true that the end result doesn&#39;t sound Sanskrit. It lacks many features essential to any stage of Indo Aryan</p>&mdash; उ॒ग्रश्र॑वस् (@Ugrashravas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ugrashravas/status/1873741227209941501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>

Despite the long discussions in these threads [[1]](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1874494292301131909), [[2]](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1875129521202229617) (which were met with increasingly dismissive replies) we continued the conversation in private. There, we pointed out several key issues: the language lacked a consistent case system and verbal conjugation, phoneme frequencies resembled *no* form of Sanskrit ([as later rigorously shown](https://x.com/khoomeik/status/1882058141145403817) by [@khoomeik](https://x.com/khoomeik)), and the translations lacked grammar.

Upon reviewing his method, we found his "dictionary" turned out to be just a [list of stems — not actual words](methodology-flaws.md#the-dictionary-used-contains-exclusively-gibberish). We urged him to try using a real one.

To summarize, our core claim was:
1. Yajnadevam's outputs aren’t Sanskrit — they violate basic grammar
2. His method is so unconstrained that *anything* can be force-fitted as ungrammatical "Sanskrit"

To the first point, he replied ["You don't know what the Harappans wrote"](https://x.com/yajnadevam/status/1874454050026230135). This dodges the issue. If the result is claimed to be Sanskrit, it must follow Sanskrit grammar — not hypothetical Harappan usage.

To the second<!-- ([which others had also pointed out](https://x.com/SebastianNehrd2/status/1897554610510029200)) -->, he replied with a dismissive challenge: ["Decipher the US Constitution as Sanskrit"](https://x.com/yajnadevam/status/1893915880121069864). This was likely meant to shut us up.

Instead, we took it seriously.

### The Seeds of the Pāṇini Protocol
***07 July 2025***

We applied his method (including his own phoneme classing, ungrammatical constructs, and reliance on unicity distance) to the U.S. Constitution. We used the key revealed to us by Thomas Jefferson in a dream to decode and translate the United States Constitution well past the unicity dsitance he set [at the time](unicity-history.md):

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ro" dir="ltr">Presenting the world&#39;s first decipherment of the United States Constitution as Pāṇinian Sanskrit<br><br>*Bhagavati Viśvasimaḥ*<br><br>1/n <a href="https://t.co/CQL6tGtelE">pic.twitter.com/CQL6tGtelE</a></p>&mdash; उ॒ग्रश्र॑वस् (@Ugrashravas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942250809645051909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>

The results looked exactly like his: ungrammatical Sanskrit, vague stems, and a total absence of structure. In other words, it worked.

Thus began the **Pāṇini Protocol**: which would soon become a full-scale demonstration that any text, when tortured through his method, can yield "Sanskrit" that’s just as ungrammatical as his original. What follows is a surprisingly textbook progression through all five stages of grief, triggered by [Jefferson's Key](index.md#our-solution-to-the-challenge-jeffersons-key) working too well.

## Chapter 1: Denial
### Initial Skepticism and Bewilderment
***08 July 2025***

The initial reaction from Yajnadevam and his supporters was one of confusion and disbelief, a kind of collective bewilderment. For reasons still unclear, they were unable to process the fact that a dhoti-clad Pikachu had received a magic phoneme key from Thomas Jefferson in a dream and then used it to decipher the U.S. Constitution.

This produced some charming moments where a few in the audience simply forgot to scroll:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/yajnadevam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@yajnadevam</a> gave a map for each symbol in IVC script to Devanagari. Where is that map from Roman 26 to 52 symbols from which the text can be deciphered ? Obviously that’s the key work not done. <a href="https://t.co/00zyat1dLL">https://t.co/00zyat1dLL</a></p>&mdash; INY (@inynor36) <a href="https://twitter.com/inynor36/status/1942477689530839047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>

While others remained in incredulity, firmly believing that the key’s success was a fluke:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reverse translate the Jefferson papers<br><br>They&#39;re from the same era. Let&#39;s see if you can preserve your junk assignment.<br><br>You should be able to read it with your assignment from the Constitution <a href="https://t.co/YvoY3qiSbG">https://t.co/YvoY3qiSbG</a></p>&mdash; Nana Siddharth (@NanaSiddharth) <a href="https://twitter.com/NanaSiddharth/status/1942551064793997600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>
<br>

To quell [such doubts](https://x.com/NanaSiddharth/status/1942550539075739675) about the efficiacy of Jefferson's Key, we used it to produce translations not only of [the critic's own tweet](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942565655590625370), but also of Twitter brainrot:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Turns out to be a Dravidian spy for the Aryans concerned that the Aryans didn&#39;t show up at dawn to invade his IVC fort <a href="https://t.co/z3mNR9Ujow">pic.twitter.com/z3mNR9Ujow</a></p>&mdash; उ॒ग्रश्र॑वस् (@Ugrashravas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942632943312146555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>

### Early Foreshadowing

Yajnadevam himself, was apparently [on vacation](https://x.com/yajnadevam/status/1942969902287175990) and had [not read my decipherment yet](https://x.com/yajnadevam/status/1942958381238796782). Nevertheless, he quickly surfaced to confidently announce that my unicity distance was wrong:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your unicity distance is incorrect… first of all, you neglect the fact that most of these text is in lower case and your brahmi mapping also works only for upper case. Secondly you are mapping LL to A which means your cipher is no longer just homophonic. Needs recomputation.</p>&mdash; yajnadevam (@yajnadevam) <a href="https://twitter.com/yajnadevam/status/1942601168427126867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>

The lowercase complaint was a complete red herring. The ciphertext under consideration was [entirely uppercase](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942603213213163534) to begin with (in scriptio continua too, like the Indus seals), making the objection moot. The "LL to A" point was (apart from being flatly false) equally hollow, given his own decipherment tolerates far [sloppier symbol clustering](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942603919034589495). In hindsight, this irrelevant objection, and a [misrepresentation of my position as "a challenge to information theory"](https://x.com/yajnadevam/status/1942610250433191961) foreshadowed [the wave of goalpost-shifting](dancing-goalposts.md) that would soon follow.

### Still Unconvinced?! Sigh...
***09-10 July 2025***

While Yajnadevam was still on vacation and hadn’t yet read the decipherment, his [followers remained unconvinced](https://x.com/inynor36/status/1942931336819540440). They couldn’t bring themselves to believe that my key was [actually revealed in a dream](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942935760207770091) and hence magical — perhaps imagining that I had brute-forced some "algorithm" on a "dataset" or whatever else made it easier to sleep at night. At first, we were responding to these doubts individually:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ca" dir="ltr">These words are about Aśvamedha ritual &amp; metrical intricacies of Ṛgveda <a href="https://t.co/tO61IE3Mdt">pic.twitter.com/tO61IE3Mdt</a></p>&mdash; उ॒ग्रश्र॑वस् (@Ugrashravas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ugrashravas/status/1943152902245056722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>

But soon, this became tedious and frankly, beneath us. So we went straight for the final nail in the coffin, and translated Nietzsche's German:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No crude algorithms. No brute force. No overfitting.<br>It’s not tied to your teeny tiny toy datasets.<br><br>I just deciphered a GERMAN text beyond unicity with the same key.<br><br>This is what Dream-Revealed keys do.<br><br>Next up: NIETZSCHE <br>In the original Sanskrit, of course! <a href="https://t.co/OCYFTNZSIE">pic.twitter.com/OCYFTNZSIE</a></p>&mdash; उ॒ग्रश्र॑वस् (@Ugrashravas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ugrashravas/status/1943143128032309745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>

### Initial "Rebuttals" That Exposed the Blueprint
***09-10 July 2025***

Two days after the decipherment, the responses began to shift from knee-jerk dismissal to actual engagement. But most critiques ended up questioning assumptions that were straight out of Yajnadevam’s own method — effectively dismantling the very thesis they were trying to defend.

For example, Yajnadevam claimed that my unicity distance was "much larger than the constitution, perhaps much much larger" ([[1]](https://x.com/yajnadevam/status/1942967993727685117),[[2]](https://x.com/yajnadevam/status/1942956334946898134)), without providing a number or even a formula. Ironically, I had computed the unicity distance using the same method in his draft, making the objection an inadvertent admission that his formula was flawed. He would later concede this in opaque terms:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My understanding of how to compute the UD has improved recently. I will post a comprehensive calculation soon. <a href="https://t.co/Tym0ZhcQhM">https://t.co/Tym0ZhcQhM</a></p>&mdash; yajnadevam (@yajnadevam) <a href="https://twitter.com/yajnadevam/status/1944871511636238390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>


Still unwilling to accept that Jefferson’s Key had actually worked, Yajnadevam tried to move the goalpost by demanding that my method work for [any Latin alphabet text](https://x.com/yajnadevam/status/1942957670098489719). Meanwhile, some of his followers began innovating novel approaches to deflect from the results, like questioning the [*entropy* of the translations](https://x.com/NanaSiddharth/status/1943356218275193150) and demanding [Sanskrit be reverse-translated with my key](https://x.com/SaintShitposter/status/1942864243138978049), while others admitted to [lacking technical competence in arithmetic](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942924272030138817):

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="img/division.png" alt="division error tweet" width="400">
</div>
<br>

In parallel, some began pointing out what they saw as glaring flaws: the key had [ambiguous phoneme classes](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942906579504001422), many-to-many mappings ([[1]](https://x.com/NanaSiddharth/status/1942945437645738164),[[2]](https://x.com/Ugrashravas/status/1942952899409072150),[[3]](https://x.com/SaintShitposter/status/1943356943525171274)), and other such horrors. Unfortunately for them, these were faithful imitations of Yajnadevam's method. In trying to critique our work, they accidentally spotlighted the nonsensical mechanics of his entire system:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🧵<br><br>Criticisms of my [divinely inspired] decipherment that actually end up exposing nonsensical &amp; convenient assumptions in YD sir&#39;s [human, fallible] decipherment that were never questioned by YD fans<br><br>I again urge YD fans to read their own website first:<a href="https://t.co/4DubJLmDZ2">https://t.co/4DubJLmDZ2</a></p>&mdash; उ॒ग्रश्र॑वस् (@Ugrashravas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ugrashravas/status/1943199045054234900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>
<br>

### The Challenge Ascends to Mythical Status
***10 July 2025***

At this point, rather than admit the demonstration succeeded, Yajnadevam launched into monologue:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Challenges to my decipherment are like video game levels. The lowest level/tutorial level are people who mostly do emotional ranting and point out that my work doesn’t agree with those before me. Little to no domain knowledge. Like the people on quora and Reddit.

</div>
<br>

Apparently, I had become the final boss who had challenged information theory itself. In truth, all I did was point out what any honest student of Sanskrit and mathematics could have. This refutation was the casual work of a bored student over a weekend, not some grand academic takedown.

Yet, our method turned out to be effective enough to [trigger a meltdown](https://x.com/search?q=from%3Ayajnadevam%20or%20from%3Athebutterthief%20or%20from%3Ananasiddharth%20or%20from%3Asaintshitposter%20ugrashravas&src=typed_query&f=top). And who doesn’t enjoy a bit of drama? Naturally, we grabbed the opportunity, and that’s how the Pāṇini Protocol was born:
